onInputChange(event)

this gives you event.target.value which is whatever the user put in to say a search bar or something

callbacks (skullians not scallians)

this.onInputChange is used without the () because for callbacks we give an event listener a refernece to the function so it can use it later when needed 

onChange is a props for callback and event handling

onClick
onChange
onSubmit

are examples of these

when naming a callback handler function you do
onInputChange is something we created.
on and then Input for <input> and Change for input field changing.

callbacks can be called whatever but props like onChange must be called that.

we want controlled elements so we refactor uncontrolled elements like the searchbar

controlled means we store the value in the component and not the DOM


async and axios

axios uses .then (() => {

})

async instead is put infront of the function name and then we put the function action in a const
